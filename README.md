# Life
Using computer programming to annoy people!

## How to annoy your friends and enjoy your life?
Yes! Of course, you need to create a virus, but you are not such a bad person! So, you need a pseudovirus! And that's exactly what I did here. My own "Game of Life" algorithm runs on the screen just like a screensaver but cannot finish easily. I developed this program in high school 2003, and put it into the startup folder of my friends' computers, and they thought it was a virus! But never mind that, because you can quit by pressing Alt+F4. I hope you can also annoy your friends way too much with this funny app and enjoy your life! I call this: "Using science to annoy people".
