# Life
My "Game of Life" algorithm runs on the screen just like a screensaver. I developed this program in high school and put it into the startup folder of my friends' computers, and they thought it was a virus! But never mind, because you can quit by pressing Alt+F4. I hope you can also annoy your friends with this funny app!
